The navigation part features an unorded list form which we can by clicking on the titles go to every webpage.
The actual  webpage where the user is gets a underline by the class="active" .

In the header part we have the h1 and h4 title by clicking on them we return to the Homepage.
In the checkbox we use an icon to open and close a dropdown menu from which we can access all webpages.
this is used on small screens like smartphones.
